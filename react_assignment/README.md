# Words of Wisdom For Today

A simple, elegant web application that uses OpenAI's GPT API to generate inspiring words of wisdom. This project demonstrates API integration with a generative AI service.

## Overview

This application provides users with daily words of wisdom generated by OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model. Users simply enter their API key, click a button, and receive thoughtful, inspiring messages powered by artificial intelligence.

## Features

- **Simple Interface**: Clean, user-friendly design with a single button click
- **Real-time Generation**: Instantly generates unique wisdom using OpenAI's API
- **Secure Storage**: API key is stored locally in your browser (localStorage)
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices
- **Beautiful UI**: Gradient backgrounds and smooth animations
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages for troubleshooting

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structure and semantic markup
- **CSS3**: Styling with gradients, animations, and responsive design
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: API integration and DOM manipulation
- **OpenAI API**: GPT-3.5-turbo model for generating wisdom

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- A web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, etc.)
- An OpenAI API key ([Get one here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys))

### Installation Steps

1. **Download/Clone the Project**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd react_assignment
   ```

2. **No Build Process Required**
   This is a pure frontend application with no dependencies to install!

3. **Run the Application**

   Simply open `index.html` in your web browser:

   **Option 1: Double-click the file**
   - Navigate to the project folder
   - Double-click `index.html`

   **Option 2: Use a local server (recommended)**
   ```bash
   # Using Python 3
   python3 -m http.server 8000

   # Using Python 2
   python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000

   # Using Node.js (if you have it installed)
   npx serve
   ```

   Then open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8000`

4. **Enter Your API Key**
   - Get your OpenAI API key from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
   - Paste it into the "OpenAI API Key" field in the application
   - Your key will be saved in your browser's localStorage for future use

5. **Get Your Wisdom!**
   - Click the "Get Today's Words of Wisdom" button
   - Wait a moment while the AI generates your wisdom
   - Enjoy your personalized message!

## How It Works

### API Integration Process

1. **User Input**: User enters their OpenAI API key (stored securely in localStorage)

2. **Button Click**: User clicks "Get Today's Words of Wisdom"

3. **API Request**: JavaScript makes a POST request to OpenAI's Chat Completions endpoint:
   ```javascript
   POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions
   ```

4. **Request Body**: Includes:
   - Model: `gpt-3.5-turbo`
   - System message: Defines the AI as a wise philosopher
   - User message: Requests a word of wisdom
   - Parameters: `max_tokens: 150`, `temperature: 0.9`

5. **Response**: OpenAI returns a JSON response with the generated wisdom

6. **Display**: The wisdom is extracted and displayed in the UI with a timestamp

### Code Structure

```
react_assignment/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html          # Main HTML structure
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ styles.css          # All styling and animations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ script.js           # API integration and logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md           # This file
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ REFLECTION.md       # Learning reflection
```

### Key Functions in `script.js`

- **`getWisdom()`**: Main function that calls OpenAI API
- **`displayWisdom(wisdom)`**: Updates UI with the generated wisdom
- **`setLoadingState(isLoading)`**: Manages loading indicators
- **`showError(message)`** / **`hideError()`**: Error handling

## API Details

### OpenAI API Endpoint
```
https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions
```

### Request Format
```javascript
{
  "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "system",
      "content": "You are a wise philosopher..."
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Give me a unique word of wisdom..."
    }
  ],
  "max_tokens": 150,
  "temperature": 0.9
}
```

### Response Format
```javascript
{
  "choices": [
    {
      "message": {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "Your words of wisdom here..."
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Security Considerations

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Security Notes:**

- **API Key Storage**: This application stores your API key in localStorage. While convenient, this is only suitable for personal use or development.
- **Client-Side Exposure**: The API key is visible in browser developer tools. Never share your screen while the key is entered.
- **Production Use**: For production applications, always use a backend server to hide API keys.
- **API Key Permissions**: Use API keys with limited permissions and monitor usage.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Please enter your OpenAI API key first"**
   - Make sure you've entered your API key in the input field
   - The key should start with `sk-`

2. **"Failed to fetch wisdom from OpenAI"**
   - Check that your API key is valid
   - Ensure you have credits in your OpenAI account
   - Check your internet connection

3. **CORS Errors**
   - OpenAI API supports CORS, but if you see CORS errors, try using a local server instead of file:// protocol
   - Use `python3 -m http.server` or similar

4. **Rate Limit Errors**
   - You may have exceeded OpenAI's rate limits
   - Wait a moment and try again
   - Check your OpenAI account usage

## Cost Considerations

- This app uses GPT-3.5-turbo, which is cost-effective
- Each wisdom generation costs approximately $0.0001 - $0.0002
- Monitor your usage at [OpenAI Usage Dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/usage)

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for this project:

- [ ] Save favorite wisdom quotes
- [ ] Share wisdom on social media
- [ ] Multiple wisdom categories (motivation, philosophy, humor)
- [ ] Daily wisdom history/calendar
- [ ] Different AI models (GPT-4, Claude, etc.)
- [ ] Theme customization
- [ ] Multi-language support
